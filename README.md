# OpenGL-Mandlebrot-Renderer
A Mandlebrot set renderer that uses OpenGL

With a GTX 970 graphics card it takes 0.67 seconds to perform 40 renders at increasing zoom levels (compare to timings at https://github.com/Mikey-R/Optimised-Mandelbrot-Renderer).

A video of the program running in real time can be found at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlCYGvQzEXo

Please note that YouTube's compression severely reduces the detail in the video.

Requires glew, freeglut and glfw3.
